    "This experiment guide includes nine experiments, introducing basic equipment operation and\n",
    "Configuration, TensorFlow's helloworld, sessions, matrix multiplication, TensorFlow\n",
    "Virtualization, and housing price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment 1: \"Hello, TensorFlow\".\n",
    "- Experiment 2: Understand functions of sessions through a session experiment using the with session function.\n",
    "- Experiment 3: Understand matrix multiplication by multiplying two matrices with ranks of tensors greater than 2.\n",
    "- Experiment 4: Understand the definition of variables. \n",
    "  - Define variables with Variable and get_variable respectively and observe the difference between these two methods.\n",
    "- Experiment 5: Understand the visualization of TensorBoard. \n",
    "  - TensorBoard aggregates all kinds of data into a log file. \n",
    "  - You can enable TensorBoard service to read the log file and enable the 6060 port to provide web services so that users can view data via a browser.\n",
    "- Experiment 6: Understand data reading and processing by reading .csv files and displaying them based on given conditions.\n",
    "- Experiment 7: Understand graphic operations. \n",
    "  - Create a graph in three ways and set it as the default graph. Use the get_default_graph() function to access the default graph and verify its settings.\n",
    "- Experiment 8: Understand save and use of models. \n",
    "  - After importing data, analyze data characteristics and define variables based on the characteristics. \n",
    "  - Create a model and define output nodes. \n",
    "  - Build the structure for forward propagation and then the structure for backpropagation. \n",
    "  - Compile and train the model to get appropriate parameters. \n",
    "  - After training data and testing the model, create a saver and a path to save parameters in the session automatically. \n",
    "  - When the model is saved, you can access the model for use.\n",
    "- Experiment 9: A comprehensive experiment of forecasting housing price through the instantiation of linear regression. \n",
    "  - Use the dataset of housing prices in Beijing and skills in the prior eight experiments to forecast the housing price."
